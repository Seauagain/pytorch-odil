# pytorch-odil
Pytorch implementation for ODIL (Optimizing a Discrete Loss) framework of solving inverse and data assimilation problems for partial differential equations.

# Note
The original [odil codebase](https://github.com/cselab/odil) provides deep learning backend support for TensorFlow and JAX. We extend this capability to include PyTorch. Additional details can be found in the original [repository](https://github.com/cselab/odil).
